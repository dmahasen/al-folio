I am a senior lecturer in Statistics attached to the Department of Statistics and Computer Science University of Peradeniya. 

Since completing my PhD in September 2019 at QUT, I have dedicated my research endeavors to developing innovative methods and algorithms to enhance efficiency and accuracy of simulation-based inference techniques by exploiting machine learning techniques. I am particularly interested in automating the construction of informative summary statistics essential for approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) algorithms like ABC-SMC. 

## Research Interests
1. Approximate Bayesian Computation
2. Bayesian Experimental designs for complex models
3. Spatial and spatio-temporal modelling
